My mini project is a game that helps you practice card counting for blackjack. 
Running the code will bring you to a starting screen where you have four options: Start, Instructions, Statistics, and Exit. Start will begin the game, Instructions describes card counting and how to play the game, and Exit quits the program. 
The Statistics feature works a little differently this time, and the statistics are only going to be displayed after the game ends.
If the player chooses 'Start', they are prompted to type in their name. Then the game begins. 
A statement will show what card was pulled and the player has to type in what they think the running count is.
The statistics that are recorded are rounds played, total correct guesses, and total incorrect guesses.
The game goes until 52 rounds have been played, indicating that the player has played through an entire deck.
