My mini project is a game that helps you practice card counting for blackjack. Running the code will bring you to a starting screen where you have four options: Start, Instructions, Statistics, and Exit. Start will begin the game, Instructions describes card counting and how to play the game, Statistics prints out the contents of the stats.txt file, and Exit quits the program. If the player chooses 'Start', they are prompted to type in their name. Then the game begins. A statement will show what card was pulled and the player has to type in what they think the running count is. Every five rounds, the game will let the player know if they are correct or not with their guess and will be promted if they want to continue or stop. The statistics that are recorded are rounds played, total correct guesses, and total incorrect guesses.
