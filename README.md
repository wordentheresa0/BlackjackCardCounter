# CS 276 Programming Languages.
This repository holds code for one of the computer science classes I am taking right now. 
The class involves learning many different programming languages and writing the same mini-project for each of these languages.
We have covered Python, Go, Scheme, and Javascript, and we are currently learning Haskell.
The mini-project I have chosen this semester is a Blackjack Card Counting Practice Game. Each project is terminal-based and includes a README file that includes instructions on how to run the program.
